## Alarm Clock

### 1.1 DATA STRUCTURES

> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed struct or struct member, global or static variable, typedef, or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

#### New

##### `sleep_list` (thread.c)

List of processes in THREAD_BLOCKED state that are sleeping until some predetermined tick value.

```c
static struct list sleep_list;
```

#### Changed

##### `thread` (thread.h)

Added `wakeup_tick`: tick value at which the thread will be unblocked.

```c
struct thread
{
    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    tid_t tid;                          /**< Thread identifier. */
    enum thread_status status;          /**< Thread state. */
    char name[16];                      /**< Name (for debugging purposes). */
    uint8_t *stack;                     /**< Saved stack pointer. */
    int priority;                       /**< Priority. */
    struct list_elem allelem;           /**< List element for all threads list. */

    /* Shared between thread.c and synch.c. */
    struct list_elem elem;              /**< List element. */

#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /**< Page directory. */
#endif

    /* Owned by devices/timer.c */
    int64_t wakeup_tick;               /**< Thread-blocking sleep */

    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    uint32_t magic;                     /**< Detects stack overflow. */
};
```

### 1.2 ALGORITHMS

> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.
> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
> the timer interrupt handler?

### 1.3 SYNCHRONIZATION

> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
> during a call to timer_sleep()?

### 1.4 RATIONALE

> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
> another design you considered?

## Priority Scheduling

### 2.1 DATA STRUCTURES

> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed struct or struct member, global or static variable, typedef, or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
> .png file.)

### 2.2 ALGORITHMS

> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?
> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?
> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

### 2.3 SYNCHRONIZATION

> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
> this race?

### 2.4 RATIONALE

> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
> another design you considered?

## Advanced Scheduler

### 3.1 DATA STRUCTURES

> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed struct or struct member, global or static variable, typedef, or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

### 3.2 ALGORITHMS

> C2: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

### 3.3 RATIONALE

> C3: Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and
> disadvantages in your design choices.  If you were to have extra
> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
> refine or improve your design?
> C4: The assignment explains arithmetic for fixed-point math in
> detail, but it leaves it open to you to implement it.  Why did you
> decide to implement it the way you did?  If you created an
> abstraction layer for fixed-point math, that is, an abstract data
> type and/or a set of functions or macros to manipulate fixed-point
> numbers, why did you do so?  If not, why not?
