## Alarm Clock

### 1.1 DATA STRUCTURES

> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed struct or struct member, global or static variable, typedef, or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

#### New

##### `sleep_list` (thread.c)

List of threads in `THREAD_BLOCK` state that are sleeping until some predetermined tick value.

```c
static struct list sleep_list;
```

#### Changed

##### `thread` (thread.h)

Added `wakeup_tick`: tick value at which the thread will be unblocked.

```c
struct thread
{
    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    tid_t tid;                          /**< Thread identifier. */
    enum thread_status status;          /**< Thread state. */
    char name[16];                      /**< Name (for debugging purposes). */
    uint8_t *stack;                     /**< Saved stack pointer. */
    int priority;                       /**< Priority. */
    struct list_elem allelem;           /**< List element for all threads list. */

    /* Shared between thread.c and synch.c. */
    struct list_elem elem;              /**< List element. */

#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /**< Page directory. */
#endif

    /* Owned by devices/timer.c */
    int64_t wakeup_tick;               /**< Thread-blocking sleep */

    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    uint32_t magic;                     /**< Detects stack overflow. */
};
```

### 1.2 ALGORITHMS

> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

The wake up tick of the thread calling `timer_sleep()` is calculated and stored as a member of its struct. The thread is then added to `sleep_list` and finally blocked by calling `thread_block()`, which will set its status to `THREAD_BLOCK` and call `schedule()` to find a new thread to run.

On the other hand, the timer interrupt handler will check if any threads in `sleep_list` are ready to wake up. If so, they are popped from `sleep_list` and unblocked by calling `thread_unblock()`, which sets their status to `THREAD_READY` and adds them to `ready_list`.

> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
> the timer interrupt handler?

Every insertion of a new thread into `sleep_list` is done in a sorted manner: the ones to wake up earlier positioned before the rest. This way, we don't have the check the whole list on every interrupt to find which threads to wake up. We only need to iterate until we find the first thread that is not ready to wake up yet, since every thread after that will also not be ready. A lot of the times, we can stop at the first element.

```
                               ticks: 113
         (front)                                        (back)
                  +---+   +---+   +---+   +---+   +---+           
           NULL - | t | - | t | - | t | - | t | - | t | - NULL
                  +---+   +---+   +---+   +---+   +---+
wakeup_tick:      111     112     115     140     148
                  |       |       |
                  |       |       |
wake up ----------+-------+       |
stop here ------------------------+
```

### 1.3 SYNCHRONIZATION

> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

As mentioned, a call to `timer_sleep()` causes a insertion into `sleep_list`. Atomicity must be enforced when altering shared data structures to avoid corruption. This is done by disabling interrupts during the insertion, which prevents other threads from being scheduled and calling `timer_sleep()`.

> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
> during a call to timer_sleep()?

The thread is blocked only after inserting it to `sleep_list`. A timer interrupt between these two steps might try to unblock the thread before it has been even blocked. To avoid this, the critical section encompasses both the insertion and blocking of the thread.

### 1.4 RATIONALE

> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
> another design you considered?

We considered adding a zero-initialized semaphore member to `struct thread`, decremented by `timer_sleep()` to block the thread, and incremented by the timer interrupt handler to unblock it. This turned out to be a waste of space, since every semaphore stores a list of threads waiting on it, which is not needed in this case. We can use `thread_block()` and `thread_unblock()` directly and achieve the same result, disabling interrupts when it's necessary.
