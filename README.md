Welcome to our little course development space, expect to find not much but
yap in the form of code

## Project Repository Structure

```sh
drwxr-xr-x - assignments
                +- buckets for each course assignment/laboratory

drwxr-xr-x - misc-scripts
                +- additional script buckets made as small experiments

drwxr-xr-x - notes
                +- additional notes about certain topics/modules related to
                   Pintos/Operating Systems in general

drwxr-xr-x - pintos-dev
                +- this is upstream pintos "patched" with whatever is needed to
                   comply with the course `assignments`
```
