# Conditional variables


```c
/** Condition variable. */
struct condition
{
    struct list waiters;        /**< List of waiting threads. */
};

void cond_init (struct condition *);
void cond_wait (struct condition *, struct lock *);
void cond_signal (struct condition *, struct lock *);
void cond_broadcast (struct condition *, struct lock *);
```

In order to fully implement the basic priority scheduler, I need to fully
understand what a `conditional variable` is.

Condition variables store 1 single thing: a list of semaphores, this due to the
original rationale behind their existence, which is the "unintuitive" approach
sempahores give to synchronization problems, as exposed in [https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/kirkpams/OpenCSF/Books/csf/html/Condvars.html](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/kirkpams/OpenCSF/Books/csf/html/Condvars.html):

Condvars overcome this by "waiting" and "signaling" (waking up) one or more
threads by the controlling the semaphores they were blocked by. This may sound a
little weird so let's take a look at the code instead:

```c
/** One semaphore in a list. */
struct semaphore_elem
{
    struct list_elem elem;              /**< List element. */
    struct semaphore semaphore;         /**< This semaphore. */
};

void
cond_wait (struct condition *cond, struct lock *lock)
{
    struct semaphore_elem waiter;

    ASSERT (cond != NULL);
    ASSERT (lock != NULL);
    ASSERT (!intr_context ());
    ASSERT (lock_held_by_current_thread (lock));

    sema_init (&waiter.semaphore, 0);
    list_push_back (&cond->waiters, &waiter.elem);
    lock_release (lock);
    sema_down (&waiter.semaphore);
    lock_acquire (lock);
}
```

As you can see, the condvar is releasing some lock and then storing a semaphore
in the `cond::waiters` list, this before blocking the thread.

The thread is not ever going to wake up again unless the semaphore that blocked
it goes up again (that is, by using `sema_up()`).

```c
void
cond_signal (struct condition *cond, struct lock *lock UNUSED)
{
  ASSERT (cond != NULL);
  ASSERT (lock != NULL);
  ASSERT (!intr_context ());
  ASSERT (lock_held_by_current_thread (lock));

  if (!list_empty (&cond->waiters))
    sema_up (&list_entry (list_pop_front (&cond->waiters),
                          struct semaphore_elem, elem)->semaphore);
}
```

Et vÃ²ila, a previously blocked thread which semaphore was now stored by the
condvar now gets waken up by `sema_up`'ing its semaphore. Repeat this logic in a
loop and you have a "broadcast" that will wake up every thread:

```c
void
cond_broadcast (struct condition *cond, struct lock *lock)
{
  ASSERT (cond != NULL);
  ASSERT (lock != NULL);

  while (!list_empty (&cond->waiters))
    cond_signal (cond, lock);
}
```
